# LOC-I Ontology
This is a specialised version of the [GeoSPARQL Ontology](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosparql) that describes classes of objects and properties defined by 
the [LOC-I](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/DIPAAnalyticHubs/Location+Integration+Capability+Loc-I) project.

This ontology contrains both normative instruction on what constitutes LOC-I objects and supplies executable constraints to validate instances.

**NOTE**: this ontology is currenty an incomplete, non-functional draft.


## Contents 
The resources in this profile are:
* **[model.html](model.html)** - normative definitions of classes and properties defined by this ontology, non-normative alignments to other ontologies, examples and nother notes
* **[model.ttl](ontology.html)** - formal definitions of classes and properties defined by this ontology in RDF 
* **[alignments.ttl](alignments.ttl)** - RDF alignments to well-known ontologies are given
* **[profile.ttl](profiledesc.ttl)** - a formal description of how this ontology relates to other resources using the [Profiles Ontology](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profilesont/)
* **[constraints-shacl.ttl](constraints-shacl.ttl)** - RDF data shape constraints using the [Shapes Constraint Language, SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) to be used to validate LOC-I class instances
